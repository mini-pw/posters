In the first project, students faced the task of preparing a poster. The topic was very interesting and timely, as it was dedicated to climate change and environmental protection. Considering learning ggplot2 from scratch, the results are fantastic. You can check it out below!

### [Introduction to exploratory data analysis](https://github.com/MI2-Education/posters/tree/main/2020-2021/ExploratoryDataAnalysis)

How to tell an interesting story? During classes we spend time learning the types of plots we can use to make sense of our data. It is also important to be able to tell the story hidden in the data to others. To do this, students made posters about movies, series, books, and games.
